# Photo_Organizer
Using darknet pre-trained neural network and openCV to organize photos from a photoshoot based on number of bottles in the image.
The project uses a pre-trained darknet and openCV to organize over a thousand photos into seperate folders by the number of bottles in the picture.
In the pictures with only 1 bottle, I would try to read the label, for which there are 5 options.
The results of the project were quite mixed. I have not measured the success rate in terms of percentages, but over half of the pictures seem to be organized properly by the number of bottles in the picture.
Reading the label was a much bigger challenge, as based on the angle, the correct of the label was nearly impossible to consistently get.
An interesting and partially successful of some things I had learned in my computer vision classes.
